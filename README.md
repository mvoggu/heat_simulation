Simulate heat flow in a cement kiln and identify outliers to gain insights on increasing efficiency of the kiln.

How it works:
Radiation & Convection losses of heat from cement kiln are calculated based on temperature readings measured from the surface of the cement kiln and ambient air velocity of kiln and are summed up to get the total heat loss from the kiln
Based on the obtained heat loss values, using IQR method, outliers(regions of the cement kiln with unusually high/low heat loss) are identified, which can potentially be damaged regions of the cement kiln
